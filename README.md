Hello,

This is a program that will be useful for visualizing holomorphic functions on the Argand plane.

This is the first time I'm writing a projectin OpenGL 3.3+ and GLFW. Some of my construction therefore may look very non-standard. 

To compile the program

1) Arrange all the dependencies.

2) Run the makefile using a 'make' command.

3) Run the executable that (2) created.

You can find animated demonstrations of this program here:
