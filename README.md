Hello,

This is a program that will be useful for visualizing holomorphic functions on the argand plane.

This is the first time I'm writing a projectin OpenGL 3.3+. Some of my construction therefore may be very non-standard. 

To compile the program

1) Arrange all the dependencies

2) Run the makefile using a 'make' command
